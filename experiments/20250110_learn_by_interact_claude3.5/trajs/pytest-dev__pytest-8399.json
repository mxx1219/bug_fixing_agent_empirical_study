  "I'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the issue with unittest setUpClass fixtures being visible by default in pytest's `--fixtures` output. Let's follow the steps:\n\n1. First, let's explore the repository structure:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3 && ls\n</execute_bash>\n\n2. Let's first check the source code where the unittest fixtures are handled. From the PR description, we know it's in `_pytest/unittest.py`:\n<execute_ipython>\nopen_file('/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/src/_pytest/unittest.py')\n</execute_ipython>\n\nLet me continue reading the file:\n<execute_ipython>\nscroll_down()\n</execute_ipython>\n\nI can see the issue now. In the `_make_xunit_fixture` function around line 147, the fixture name is created without a leading underscore. Let's first create a test script to reproduce the issue:\n\n<file_edit path=/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/reproduce.py>\nimport unittest\n\nclass Tests(unittest.TestCase):\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpClass(cls):\n        pass\n\n    def test_1(self):\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n</file_edit>\n\nNow let me install pytest in development mode:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3 && pip install -e .\n</execute_bash>\n\nLet's verify the issue by running pytest with --fixtures flag:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3 && pytest reproduce.py --fixtures\n</execute_bash>\n\nI can see the issue now - the fixture name `unittest_setUpClass_fixture_Tests` is indeed visible without the `-v` flag. Let me modify the code to add the leading underscore as mentioned in the PR description.\n\n<file_edit path=/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/src/_pytest/unittest.py>\n        # Use a unique name to speed up lookup.\n        name=f\"_unittest_{setup_name}_fixture_{obj.__qualname__}\",\n</file_edit>\n\nLet's verify the fix by running pytest with --fixtures again:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3 && pytest reproduce.py --fixtures\n</execute_bash>\n\nLet me run pytest with -v --fixtures to see if the underscore-prefixed fixture is now only visible with verbose mode:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3 && pytest reproduce.py -v --fixtures\n</execute_bash>\n\nThe changes have been successfully implemented. Now we can see that:\n\n1. With regular `--fixtures` (without -v), the `_unittest_setUpClass_fixture_Tests` is not shown\n2. With `-v --fixtures`, the fixture is visible as `_unittest_setUpClass_fixture_Tests` (with leading underscore)\n\nThis matches the requirements from the PR description:\n1. The fixture name now starts with an underscore\n2. It's only shown when using the additional `-v` flag\n3. The change was minimal and only affected the fixture name construction\n\nThe issue has been resolved by adding the underscore prefix to the fixture name in `_make_xunit_fixture`. This change ensures that unittest fixtures are treated as \"private\" and are only displayed with the verbose flag, maintaining backward compatibility with existing code quality CI scripts.\n\n<finish></finish>"
