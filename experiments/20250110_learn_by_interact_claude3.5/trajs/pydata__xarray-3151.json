  "I'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the issue with `xr.combine_by_coords`. Let's follow the steps you outlined:\n\n1. First, let's explore the repository structure:\n<execute_bash>\nls /workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12\n</execute_bash>\n\n2. Let's create a script to reproduce the error. We'll place it in the root directory:\n\n<file_edit path=\"/workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12/reproduce.py\">\nimport xarray as xr\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Non-monotonic y coordinates\nyCoord = ['a', 'c', 'b']  \n\nds1 = xr.Dataset(\n    data_vars=dict(\n        data=(['x', 'y'], np.random.rand(3, 3))\n    ),\n    coords=dict(\n        x=[1, 2, 3],\n        y=yCoord\n    )\n)\n\nds2 = xr.Dataset(\n    data_vars=dict(\n        data=(['x', 'y'], np.random.rand(4, 3))\n    ),\n    coords = dict(\n        x=[4, 5, 6, 7],\n        y=yCoord\n    )\n)\n\nprint(\"Attempting to combine datasets...\")\nds3 = xr.combine_by_coords((ds1, ds2))\nprint(\"Successfully combined!\")\n</file_edit>\n\nNow let's install xarray and run the script to verify the error:\n\n<execute_ipython>\n%pip install -e /workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12\n</execute_ipython>",
  "Let's run the reproduction script to confirm the error:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12 && python reproduce.py\n</execute_bash>",
  "Great, we've reproduced the error. The issue occurs in `combine_by_coords` where it's checking for monotonicity on dimensions that don't vary between datasets.\n\nLet's look at the `combine.py` file where the issue is:\n<execute_ipython>\nopen_file('/workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12/xarray/core/combine.py')\n</execute_ipython>",
  "Let me scroll down to find the `combine_by_coords` function where the error is being raised:\n<execute_ipython>\nscroll_down()\n</execute_ipython>",
  "Let me continue scrolling down to find where the error is being raised:\n<execute_ipython>\nscroll_down()\n</execute_ipython>",

  "I found the issue. The problem is in `combine_by_coords` around line 504-511 where it's checking for monotonicity on all dimensions, even those that don't vary between datasets. According to the docstring comment on line 406-407: \"Non-coordinate dimensions will be ignored, as will any coordinate dimensions which do not vary between each dataset.\"\n\nLet's modify the code to only check monotonicity for dimensions that actually vary between datasets:\n\n<file_edit path=\"/workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12/xarray/core/combine.py\" start=503 end=511>\n        # Check the overall coordinates are monotonically increasing\n        # Only check dimensions that are being concatenated\n        for dim in concat_dims:\n            if dim in concatenated:\n                indexes = concatenated.indexes.get(dim)\n                if not (indexes.is_monotonic_increasing\n                        or indexes.is_monotonic_decreasing):\n                    raise ValueError(\"Resulting object does not have monotonic\"\n                                     \" global indexes along dimension {}\"\n                                     .format(dim))\n</file_edit>\n\nThe key change is replacing `for dim in concatenated.dims:` with `for dim in concat_dims:`. This ensures we only check monotonicity for dimensions that are actually being concatenated, which are the ones that vary between datasets.\n\nLet me verify the fix by running the reproduction script again:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12 && python reproduce.py\n</execute_bash>",
  "Let me try running the reproduction script again to verify the fix:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/pydata__xarray__0.12 && python reproduce.py\n</execute_bash>",
  "Great! The fix has worked successfully. Let me summarize what we did:\n\n1. We identified the issue: `combine_by_coords` was checking monotonicity on all dimensions, even those that didn't vary between datasets. This contradicted the documentation which states \"Non-coordinate dimensions will be ignored, as will any coordinate dimensions which do not vary between each dataset.\"\n\n2. We fixed the issue by modifying `combine_by_coords` to only check monotonicity on dimensions that were actually concatenated (those in `concat_dims`).\n\n3. We added a clarifying comment to explain that we only check dimensions that are being concatenated.\n\n4. We verified the fix by running the reproduction script, which now successfully combines datasets with non-monotonic coordinates that don't vary between datasets.\n\nThe fix is minimal and focused:\n1. Changed the loop to iterate over `concat_dims` instead of `concatenated.dims`\n2. Added a clarifying comment about only checking concatenated dimensions\n\nThe fix now correctly follows the documented behavior and allows non-monotonic coordinates when they don't vary between datasets.\n\n<finish></finish>"
