  "I'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the issue with the lookup cache not being cleared in `_unregister_lookup`. Let me follow the steps you outlined:\n\n1. First, let's explore the repository structure to locate the relevant files:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/django__django__4.1 && ls\n</execute_bash>",
  "Let's proceed with fixing the issue. Based on the PR description, we need to modify `django/db/models/query_utils.py`.\n\nFirst, let's create a script to reproduce the error:\n\n<file_edit path=\"/workspace/django__django__4.1/reproduce.py\">\nfrom django.db.models.query_utils import RegisterLookupMixin\n\nclass TestLookup:\n    lookup_name = 'test_lookup'\n\nclass TestMixin(RegisterLookupMixin):\n    class_lookups = {}\n\n# Register a lookup\nTestMixin.register_lookup(TestLookup)\nprint(\"Lookups after register:\", TestMixin.get_lookups())\n\n# Unregister the lookup\nTestMixin._unregister_lookup(TestLookup)\nprint(\"Lookups after unregister:\", TestMixin.get_lookups())  # Cache still contains old value!\n\n</file_edit>\n\nLet's run the reproduction script:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/django__django__4.1 && PYTHONPATH=. python3 reproduce.py\n</execute_bash>",
  "Let's continue by examining the `query_utils.py` file:\n\n<execute_ipython>\nopen_file('./django/db/models/query_utils.py')\n</execute_ipython>",
  "Let me scroll down to find the relevant `RegisterLookupMixin` class:\n<execute_ipython>\nscroll_down()\n</execute_ipython>",
  "Let me continue scrolling to find the `register_lookup` and `_unregister_lookup` methods:\n<execute_ipython>\nscroll_down()\n</execute_ipython>",
  "I see the issue now. In the `_unregister_lookup` method (lines 212-219), the cache is not being cleared after removing a lookup, while `register_lookup` (lines 202-209) does clear the cache.\n\nLet me modify the `_unregister_lookup` method to clear the cache:\n<file_edit path=\"./django/db/models/query_utils.py\">\n    @classmethod\n    def _unregister_lookup(cls, lookup, lookup_name=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Remove given lookup from cls lookups. For use in tests only as it's\n        not thread-safe.\n        \"\"\"\n        if lookup_name is None:\n            lookup_name = lookup.lookup_name\n        del cls.class_lookups[lookup_name]\n        cls._clear_cached_lookups()\n</file_edit>\n\nNow let's run our reproduction script to verify the fix:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/django__django__4.1 && PYTHONPATH=. python3 reproduce.py\n</execute_bash>",
  "Let me try again with the correct line range for editing `_unregister_lookup`:\n<file_edit path=./django/db/models/query_utils.py start=211 end=220>\n    @classmethod\n    def _unregister_lookup(cls, lookup, lookup_name=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Remove given lookup from cls lookups. For use in tests only as it's\n        not thread-safe.\n        \"\"\"\n        if lookup_name is None:\n            lookup_name = lookup.lookup_name\n        del cls.class_lookups[lookup_name]\n        cls._clear_cached_lookups()\n\n</file_edit>",
  "Now let's verify that our fix works by running the reproduction script:\n<execute_bash>\ncd /workspace/django__django__4.1 && PYTHONPATH=. python3 reproduce.py\n</execute_bash>",
  "The fix has been successfully implemented and verified. Let's summarize what we did:\n\n1. We identified the issue in the `_unregister_lookup` method where the lookup cache wasn't being cleared after removing a lookup.\n\n2. We created a reproduction script that demonstrated the issue by:\n   - Creating a test lookup class\n   - Registering and then unregistering the lookup\n   - Showing that before our fix, the lookup would remain in the cache after unregistering\n\n3. We added `cls._clear_cached_lookups()` to the `_unregister_lookup` method, similar to what's done in `register_lookup`.\n\n4. We verified the fix by running the reproduction script again, which shows:\n   - The lookup is properly registered (shown in first print)\n   - After unregistering, the lookup is properly removed from both the class_lookups and the cache (shown in second print being empty)\n\nThe fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue described in the PR. Since we've verified that the lookup cache is now properly cleared after unregistering a lookup, and our change matches the behavior in `register_lookup`, this completes the implementation of the requirements specified in the PR description.\n\n<finish></finish>"
