# W&B Programmer O1 Crosscheck5

Features:

- o1 with reasoning_mode high for all agent step and editing logic
- a gpt4o based memory component that compresses the agent’s step history
- a custom built python code editor toolset designed to efficiently use model context
- the ability to register “auto-commands” that run after every editing step
- 5 parallel rollouts for each instance, and a final “crosscheck” step for choosing the best rollout, using an o1 tie-breaker
