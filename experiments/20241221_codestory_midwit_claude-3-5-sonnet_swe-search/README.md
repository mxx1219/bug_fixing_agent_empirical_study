# CodeStory Midwit Agent Scaffolding

CodeStory agent ships as an extension as well as in the editor. Instead of putting energy into creating a complicated framework, we leverage test time compute to scale the performance of the agent, effectively running it at most 5 times to maximise the results generated.
This experiment shows how the bitter lesson still holds true and trivial solution with scale can lead to better performance.

Our team is currently working on developing Aide the editor and we ship the same agent natively inside the editor. We are open-source and our code is visible at [sidecar](https://github.com/codestoryai/sidecar)

We were deeply inspired by the work done by [SWE-search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20285) and want to give proper attribution to their work.
